# Summary

This project allowed me to work on transforming user data into a tabular format for readability and organization. Displaying data in a tabular fashion is a tool used widely throughout the web and important for storing data and abstracting from it. At a surface level, we can extract simple patterns from having a record of our expenses and viewing them in tabular form. In a more technical manner, I enjoyed learning how to programatically generate new rows of data via user form submission.

- Detailed Features:
    - Control snake head by pressing arrow keys.
      - Detect key presses using onKeyDown event listener.
    - Lose game if head touches the walls.
    - Lose game if head touches the body.
    - Apple relocates to random coordinates after being "eaten".
      - Apple will not relocate to where snake currently is.
    - Used setInterval() to simulate snake motion.
      - Increase or decrease speed by changing the FPS variable.
